<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Owen Keller and I am 27 year old born and raised in Pasadena, CA
  and currently living in Los Angeles. I would describe myself as someone who
  loves the outdoors and a very active, extroverted person. I have several
  hobbies and in my free time you can find me hiking and camping throughout
  California, playing guitar, skateboarding and skiing with friends and family,
  or at a park reading. On the weekends I try to spend my time with friends and
  family going to concerts and shows, sports games, or spending a night out at a
  favorite restaurant of ours. I grew up with very active parents, who similarly
  had a passion for the outdoors and traveling, which sparked the interests in
  most of the hobbies and passions I have today.

  In 2019 I graduated from San Francisco State University with a B.S. in
  Environmental Science and an emphasis in Natural Resource Management and
  Conservation. Since graduating I have had several jobs and for the last few
  years I have been working in the Production world as both a Production
  Assistant and an Art/Props Assistant. I fell into this world as some of my
  close relatives have careers in Production and having the opportunity to work
  along side family is amazing.

  From a young age I also worked under my father and uncles' construction
  company. I began working with them in my early high school years up until the
  last year or so. I have grown up around a hardworking family and have gained
  as much knowledge as I can, cherishing every chance I get to work and learn
  alongside them.

  Coming from a science background, I have grown accustomed to several programs
  I used throughout my time in college. Programs I am familiar with are:
  R-Studio, ArcGIS, and AutoCAD. I realized I enjoyed both learning and using
  these programs throughout my education and with my familiarity in these
  programs, it was quite easy for me to take the leap to begin learning other
  coding programs and focusing on Web Development. Thus began my journey into
  learning programs such as HTML, CSS and eventually making my way into the
  world of Javascript.
